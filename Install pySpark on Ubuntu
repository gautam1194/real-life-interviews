Download Anaconda from http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/ for 32/64 bit system

After downloading the Anaconda installer, run the following command from a terminal:

$ bash Anaconda.x.x.x-Linux-x86[_64].sh

After accepting the license terms, you will be asked to specify the install location (which defaults to ~/anaconda).

Note: You do NOT need root privileges to install Anaconda, if you select a user writable install location, such as ~/anaconda.* 
After the self extraction is finished, you should add the anaconda binary directory to your PATH environment variable.

How to add directory path in PATH environment variable:


Next step is to check if Java is installed on your system or not.

Run the command on your terminal to check:

java -version

If it is installed then move onto next step
other wise
Install Java from https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/linux_jdk.html

These instructions use the following file:

jdk-8uversion-linux-x64.tar.gz

    Download the file.

    Before the file can be downloaded, you must accept the license agreement. 
    The archive binary can be installed by anyone (not only root users), in any location that you can write to. 
    However, only the root user can install the JDK into the system location.

    Change directory to the location where you would like the JDK to be installed, 
    then move the .tar.gz archive binary to the current directory.

    Unpack the tarball and install the JDK.

    % tar zxvf jdk-8uversion-linux-x64.tar.gz

    The Java Development Kit files are installed in a directory called jdk1.8.0_version in the current directory.

    Delete the .tar.gz file if you want to save disk space.
    
    
Then check the java -version again.

Next is to install Spark on your system.
